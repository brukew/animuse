# To-Do

## Bugs
- Can't select or amend animations
  - [x] cant move animations
  - [ ] cant change color or size easily
- [x] undo and redo buggy asf
  - [x] generally doesnt work
  - [x] doesnt work for animations since it saves static state
    - [x] color doesnt save
- [x] delete doesnt not work with multiple selected
- [ ] pause and resume a bit buggy (drag and select an object and an animation and click off, and the animation will not resume + selecting from the animation panel then clicking off will not lead to animation resuming)

## Features to add

### General
- [x] side panel to show animation history
- [x] select objects upon clikcing entry
- [x] edit prompts 
- [ ] edit names of animated objects
- [x] fix bug where re animating an animated object doesnt remove previous entry 
  - [x] figure out reanimation and what i want from it fr - look at ids.
- [ ] filter animatiosn by recent vs date vs order on canvas
- [ ] all animations may need to wipe the object and redraw but only keep the stroke data

- [x] layering for animations
  - a bit buggy when changing layer order (might be due to fix animation) but works for demo.
  
- [x]pause and play animation
  - [ ] fix bug with moving apples on pause (align pause / resume with selection cleared)

- [ ] add directions in beginning
  - [ ] hints thrughout page + question mark that expands into directions again

### LLM
- LLM Auto animate
  - iteration tool
  - aniamtion tool
  - interaction tool
- Need to tell it to be mindful about animated items when being moved, color changed, deleted, and such
  - maybe pass in apples and birds as examples
- be able to color in objects/group as one object (i.e. a house with multiple strokes would be one object)
  - objectGroup vs animationGroup vs interactionGroup

- need to do interactions, interaction panel. more animations, buffed UI, ipad?, ordering on screen 
  - interaction paenel (animtaiton order done)
  - added fixObject animation
  - added z-index ordering

- still need inteactions, buffed UI, ipad testing, whisper, and LLM and instructions

avoid, orbit, 

avoid works for hop and birds
orbit works
join

hop sway birds for animation

would be cool if there wer adjustable settings for both animations and interactions




ccording to our previous plan, here's what's next on the list:

  1. Integrate an LLM to process commands:
    - Create an API endpoint for sending voice transcriptions to an LLM
    - Configure the LLM to understand animation-specific language
    - Parse the LLM responses into structured commands that your app can execute
  2. Expand command functionality:
    - Implement commands to create new interactions between animations
    - Add support for specific animation selection by name/type
    - Enable deletion commands for specific animations
    - Add commands to modify animation properties (color, speed, etc.)
  3. Enhanced contextual awareness:
    - Track canvas state to provide context to the LLM
    - Maintain conversation history for multi-turn commands
    - Enable commands that refer to previous actions ("make that one blue")
  4. UI improvements:
    - Add a visual indicator for which animations are being referenced
    - Implement better feedback when commands are executed
    - Add an optional transcript display of voice commands and responses

  The most logical next step would be to implement the LLM integration. This would involve setting up a way to send voice commands to an LLM service (like
  OpenAI's API), processing its responses, and mapping them to specific actions in your animation system.
