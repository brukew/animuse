# To-Do

## Bugs
- Can't select or amend animations
  - [x] cant move animations
  - [ ] cant change color or size easily
- [x] undo and redo buggy asf
  - [x] generally doesnt work
  - [x] doesnt work for animations since it saves static state
    - [x] color doesnt save
- [x] delete doesnt not work with multiple selected
- [ ] pause and resume a bit buggy (drag and select an object and an animation and click off, and the animation will not resume + selecting from the animation panel then clicking off will not lead to animation resuming)

## Features to add

### General
- [x] side panel to show animation history
- [x] select objects upon clikcing entry
- [x] edit prompts 
- [ ] edit names of animated objects
- [x] fix bug where re animating an animated object doesnt remove previous entry 
  - [x] figure out reanimation and what i want from it fr - look at ids.
- [ ] filter animatiosn by recent vs date vs order on canvas
- [ ] all animations may need to wipe the object and redraw but only keep the stroke data

- [x] layering for animations
  - a bit buggy when changing layer order (might be due to fix animation) but works for demo.
  
- [x]pause and play animation
  - [ ] fix bug with moving apples on pause (align pause / resume with selection cleared)

- [ ] add directions in beginning
  - [ ] hints thrughout page + question mark that expands into directions again

### LLM
- LLM Auto animate
  - iteration tool
  - aniamtion tool
  - interaction tool
- Need to tell it to be mindful about animated items when being moved, color changed, deleted, and such
  - maybe pass in apples and birds as examples
- be able to color in objects/group as one object (i.e. a house with multiple strokes would be one object)
  - objectGroup vs animationGroup vs interactionGroup

- need to do interactions, interaction panel. more animations, buffed UI, ipad?, ordering on screen 
  - interaction paenel (animtaiton order done)
  - added fixObject animation
  - added z-index ordering

- still need inteactions, interactions view, more animations, buffed UI, ipad testing, whisper, and LLM
