# To-Do

## Bugs
- Can't select or amend animations
  - [x] cant move animations
  - [ ] cant change color or size easily
- [x] undo and redo buggy asf
  - [x] generally doesnt work
  - [x] doesnt work for animations since it saves static state
    - [x] color doesnt save
- [x] delete doesnt not work with multiple selected
- [ ] pause and resume a bit buggy (drag and select an object and an animation and click off, and the animation will not resume + selecting from the animation panel then clicking off will not lead to animation resuming)

## Features to add

### General
- [x] side panel to show animation history
- [x] select objects upon clikcing entry
- [x] edit prompts 
- [ ] edit names of animated objects
- [x] fix bug where re animating an animated object doesnt remove previous entry 
  - [x] figure out reanimation and what i want from it fr - look at ids.
- [ ] filter animatiosn by recent vs date vs order on canvas
- [ ] all animations may need to wipe the object and redraw but only keep the stroke data

- [x] layering for animations
  - a bit buggy when changing layer order (might be due to fix animation) but works for demo.
  
- [x]pause and play animation
  - [ ] fix bug with moving sway on pause (align pause / resume with selection cleared)

- [ ] add directions in beginning
  - [ ] hints thrughout page + question mark that expands into directions again

### LLM
- LLM Auto animate
  - iteration tool
  - aniamtion tool
  - interaction tool
- Need to tell it to be mindful about animated items when being moved, color changed, deleted, and such
  - maybe pass in sway and birds as examples
- be able to color in objects/group as one object (i.e. a house with multiple strokes would be one object)
  - objectGroup vs animationGroup vs interactionGroup

- need to do interactions, interaction panel. more animations, buffed UI, ipad?, ordering on screen 
  - interaction paenel (animtaiton order done)
  - added fixObject animation
  - added z-index ordering

  buffed UI, ipad testing

avoid, orbit, 

avoid works for hop and birds
orbit works
join

hop sway birds for animation

would be cool if there wer adjustable settings for both animations and interactions




ccording to our previous plan, here's what's next on the list:

need to do
- resizing
- hop correct
- add directions
- any other bugs
- write paper
